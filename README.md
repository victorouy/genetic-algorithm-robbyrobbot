# genetic-algorithm-robbyrobbot
Implemented a genetic algorithm to evolve control strategies. Use the Monogame framework to help visualize how Robby improves over generations.

Robby the Robot roles is to collect soda cans accross a grid. Robby will evolve depending on a fitness pattern throughout multiple generations in which it improve at collecting cans as a result of evolution. Mutations are also implemented in the algorithm.
