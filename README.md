# genetic-algorithm-robbyrobbot
Implemented a genetic algorithm to evolve control strategies. Illustrated using Monogame framework to help visualize how Robby improves over the course of multiple generations.

Robby the Robot's role is to collect all the nodes accross a grid. Robby evolves depending on a fitness pattern throughout multiple generations in which it learns efficient techniques on how to find the grid nodes. Mutations are also implemented in the algorithm to allows a natural process of selection.
